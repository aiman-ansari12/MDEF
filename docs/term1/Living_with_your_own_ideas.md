Generationally, we are living in an era of sitting. We wake up, get into a car or train, and sit; then we go to college or the office, where we sit some more; and after a long day, we return home only to sit on the couch again. It’s no surprise that poor posture and back problems are becoming common from a young age. So in an attempt to counter and avoid that bad posture I designed a prosthesis which will help me sit straight wherever.

I designed Sit Tall, a prosthetic support system that helps me maintain an upright posture wherever I sit. Sit Tall works on simple principles of physics and magnetic fields. It consists of two main components. The first is a cross-like structure that rests against the back of a chair. Its horizontal member supports my shoulders, while the lower end features a small copper disc that can be adjusted vertically to match my height.

The second part is a belt fitted with an adjustable magnet. I position the belt so that the magnet sits in the concave area of my lower back. When I sit, the magnet faces the copper disc on the chair, creating opposing magnetic fields. This repelling force makes it physically difficult for my back to slouch, naturally encouraging me to sit upright.
What I like about Sit Tall is that it doesn’t just remind me to sit straight — it actually helps me in doing so. It’s a simple, physics-driven intervention that transforms posture correction from a conscious effort into an effortless physical response.

These days, everything is designed to be portable — my umbrella folds small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and my headphones collapse to fit into even my smallest purse. So I started wondering: why can’t my drinking glass do the same?

As women, we often move through the world on alert. In crowded or chaotic places, that sense of caution heightens — and one of my biggest fears has always been the possibility of someone spiking my drink.
That concern led me to design my own solution: a foldable silicon glass that disguises itself as a bracelet. It not only compresses into a compact, wearable accessory but also incorporates pH indicators that change the color of the drink if any suspicious substance is added.

With this design, I’ve created something that helps me feel safer and more at ease — a small innovation that reduces my reliance on society’s safeguards and gives me control over my own sense of security.
