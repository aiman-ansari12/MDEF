# DESIGN STUDIO 1 - THE MANIFESTs

I’ve been reflecting lately on how, in many societies, the motivation to be a “good citizen” hinges almost entirely on avoiding punishment—getting fined, going to court, suffering consequences. In places where judicial systems are slow or stretched thin, that approach becomes not just inefficient but counterproductive. Think about speeding: yes, there are penalties if you’re caught. But that still leaves two choices—either you don’t speed, or you speed and don’t get caught. If you know where the checkpoints tend to be, avoiding detection isn’t hard.
What strikes me is that being “good” under this model only means “not losing” anything. You gain nothing tangible by following rules—it’s just the absence of punishment. It’s like getting a participation certificate for something you didn’t do poorly—it’s not quite recognition, it’s just the absence of shame.
What if society flipped that, instead of only punishing bad behaviour, it rewards good behaviour? Of course “good citizens” will depend on context—a country, a community, a culture—but imagine a system where action is encouraged, not merely compliance out of fear.

One idea is a credit-based reward system: points for paying taxes on time, points for obeying traffic laws, or for volunteering. Those points could translate into concrete benefits — reduced fees, public transport discounts, lower utility bills, or priority access to public services.

Such systems are not just theoretical. Studies show that non-monetary rewards, like badges or recognition, can increase civic engagement and volunteer participation. Gamified systems often outperform non-gamified ones when it comes to sustained participation. But there’s also research that warns: if rewards are too external or feel coercive, they can undermine the idea behind it.
