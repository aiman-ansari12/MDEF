#### Pictoral of Design Narrative  
I aim to design plug-and-play resource modules—standalone, that generate energy, support food production, and manage water and waste as emergency shelters. As this includes the different  layers looking into a shelter system with self-sustainable food, energy, water and waste- I want there to be a layering in the final product as well.
A pop-up photo-book with a hierarchy and layering where I initially show the four different aspects and then show the cohesion of them into a final interconnected product.
