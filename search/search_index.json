The joy of not learning by seeing but by actually doing is like none other, and to have a physical manifestation of those learning and those errors is a valuable lesson indeed. Electronics and Barduino This was one of the most fun experiments where we got to connect inputs and outs and learn to interact with those connections through code. Laser Cutting As a group we designed a box that was later used for silicone molding. Here as we experiments with the level of detail and power of the engravings of laser, gave us important lessons such as - we learned about the importance of line spacing and kerf considerations. Our initial design had lines placed too close together, which caused cutting issues. We had to revise the design by increasing the distance between paths to ensure clean cuts. Printing For the mold-making process, we designed and 3D printed a positive model that fit inside the laser-cut box. The printed form was a maze-like structure, and an important design consideration was ensuring that all shapes were properly merged into a single manifold object to avoid printing errors.

We wake up, get into a car or train, and sit; then we go to college or the office, where we sit some more; and after a long day, we return home only to sit on the couch again. It\u2019s no surprise that poor posture and back problems are becoming common from a young age. So in an attempt to counter and avoid that bad posture I designed a prosthesis which will help me sit straight wherever. I designed Sit Tall, a prosthetic support system that helps me maintain an upright posture wherever I sit. Sit Tall works on simple principles of physics and magnetic fields. It consists of two main components. The first is a cross-like structure that rests against the back of a chair. Its horizontal member supports my shoulders, while the lower end features a small copper disc that can be adjusted vertically to match my height. The second part is a belt fitted with an adjustable magnet. I position the belt so that the magnet sits in the concave area of my lower back. When I sit, the magnet faces the copper disc on the chair, creating opposing magnetic fields. This repelling force makes it physically difficult for my back to slouch, naturally encouraging me to sit upright. What I like about Sit Tall is that it doesn\u2019t just remind me to sit straight \u2014 it actually helps me in doing so. It\u2019s a simple, physics-driven intervention that transforms posture correction from a conscious effort into an effortless physical response. Prototype 2 - PHold These days, everything is designed to be portable \u2014 my umbrella folds small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and my headphones collapse to fit into even my smallest purse. So I started wondering: why can\u2019t my drinking glass do the same? As women, we often move through the world on alert. In crowded or chaotic places, that sense of caution heightens \u2014 and one of my biggest fears has always been the possibility of someone spiking my drink. That concern led me to design my own solution: a foldable silicon glass that disguises itself as a bracelet. It not only compresses into a compact, wearable accessory but also incorporates pH indicators that change the color of the drink if any suspicious substance is added. With this design, I\u2019ve created something that helps me feel safer and more at ease \u2014 a small innovation that reduces my reliance on society\u2019s safeguards and gives me control over my own sense of security. Prototype 3 - Frog Fingers In this exercise, where we were asked to design a prosthesis based on what we aspire to become, I chose to embody a frog! Frogs are truly fascinating creatures \u2014 being among the few species capable of breathing both underwater and on land with remarkable ease. Their textured, suction-like toes provide them with exceptional grip, enabling agile movement across a wide range of surfaces. Inspired by this adaptability, I designed frog fingers \u2014 a prosthetic extension that replicates the tactile and adhesive qualities of a frog\u2019s skin. The prototype was made using layers of paper, aluminium foil, and wet tissue, materials that together mimic the combination of structure, flexibility, and moisture necessary for suction. The foil provided form and resilience, the paper added texture and support, and the damp tissue created a temporary seal when pressed against smooth surfaces, generating mild suction through air displacement. Prototype 4 - Stress Sleeves In line with the theme of frogs, one of the most fascinating characteristics of the wood frog is its remarkable ability to become, quite literally, a living icicle . During winter, the wood frog burrows beneath leaves and allows its body to freeze completely\u2014its heart stops, and brain activity comes to a halt. Meanwhile, the frog\u2019s liver produces a surge of glucose that floods every cell in its body. This syrup-like sugar solution prevents the cells from freezing and binds to water molecules, protecting the cells from dehydration. In essence, the wood frog\u2019s body permits ice to form around its cells and organs, while simultaneously preventing ice crystals from forming within the cells\u2014thus avoiding the fatal cellular damage that freezing would cause in most animals. Drawing inspiration from this extraordinary adaptation, I wanted to explore whether it\u2019s possible to design a material\u2014or a kind of \u201cstress\u201d\u2014that behaves similarly: one where the outer layer resists external stress or cold, while the inner layer remains warm and gentle against the body. Surveillance Tapes Tiny Pockets Of Stories For My Surveiler When chanced with the idea that I get to curate the experience of what my detective see's in me. I thought a lot about and decided I'll make it a game for myself - I'd challenge them to understand what I'm trying to do or show, rather than allowing them to be the ones in control. So I got red stickers and walked around aimlessly with the idea of putting the same kind of stickers for similar patterns, two for a grocery store, one for a cafe we got to regularly after class and so on. But as with life nothing goes as per your plan especially when you're adding another player into the game. So I lost my detective quite early in the game. Now the idea of this game seemed obsolete if they don't even know where to look. So I upped the game again. I sent my location in a group of my possible stalkers and then went around with the same idea of stickers but stickers as markers of how to find me. Slowly realizing I was once again doing things for them rather then for me, I started having fun with it - I left the clues but always in this tiny spots of whimsy. A street light with a funny poster, a window with a pretty reflection. Its interesting how only when it was for someone else to see we curate and look for these tiny moments of joy, but when its just us we ignore them considering ourselves not worth our own effort? Maybe in trying to be seen, I accidentally learned how to look. Reflections It\u2019s in human nature to evolve with time. Yet, the more we come to understand evolution \u2014 its slowness, its quiet patience \u2014 the more restless we seem to grow with our own biology. We\u2019ve become impatient with nature\u2019s gradual unfolding, unwilling to wait for our bodies to adapt to the demands of our imagination. So we create prosthetics, extensions, and technologies \u2014 not merely to repair or replace, but to accelerate what evolution cannot yet deliver. This workshop, bringing together such a diverse constellation of people and ideas, made me reflect on that impatience \u2014 but also on the beauty of it. Each speaker shared how their work with prosthetics and design isn\u2019t just about improving \u201cefficiency,\u201d but about expanding human experience itself. It\u2019s not only a technical pursuit, but a philosophical one \u2014 an experiment in perception. Take Manel, the cyborg artist, who decided that temperature and air pressure need not be confined to touch or smell, but could be translated into sound \u2014 transforming the invisible forces around us into something we could hear. Or Thomas Thwaites, who chose to step outside human perception altogether, living as a goat for a week to experience the world from an entirely different sensory logic. These examples revealed something profound to me: that by changing the way we experience the world, we inevitably change the way we interpret it. And when our perceptions shift, so too do our judgments \u2014 of people, of animals, of nature itself. Perhaps, then, evolution is not only biological, but perceptual \u2014 and the tools we build are not just extensions of the body, but instruments for expanding the boundaries of what it means to be human.","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#prototype-1-sit-tall","text":"","title":"Prototype 1 - Sit Tall"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#prototype-2-phold","text":"","title":"Prototype 2 - PHold"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#prototype-3-frog-fingers","text":"","title":"Prototype 3 - Frog Fingers"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#prototype-4-stress-sleeves","text":"","title":"Prototype 4 - Stress Sleeves"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#surveillance-tapes","text":"","title":"Surveillance Tapes"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#tiny-pockets-of-stories-for-my-surveiler","text":"","title":"Tiny Pockets Of Stories For My Surveiler"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term1/Narratives01/","text":"Unpacking Technology Pictoral of Design Narrative I aim to design plug-and-play resource modules\u2014standalone, that generate energy, support food production, and manage water and waste as emergency shelters.

A lot of modern technology is mostly electric and code based with a shell encasing the same. Having a mix of mechanical and electric played a large factor is choosing this as the subject for the workshop. Next Step : Taking it Apart About the machine: Brand: Rowenta Compact Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner Model: VC21VW0 Serial number: R0346301 / RO346301 Colour: ORANGE (plastic), BLACK (plastic), BLACK (resin) Made in: Germany, Romania, Spain, China, France, International What does it do? The Rowenta Compacte Cyclonic (RO346301) is a bagless canister vacuum cleaner designed for domestic dry cleaning. It utilizes high-power suction (up to 1900W) to remove dust, debris, and pet hair from various floor surfaces (hardwood, tile, carpet). Unlike traditional vacuums that rely on bags to trap dirt, this device separates dust from the air stream and stores it in a reusable bin. How does it work? The device operates on the principle of cyclonic separation: Suction Generation: A high-speed universal electric motor creates a pressure drop, drawing air in through the nozzle and hose. Cyclonic Action: The air enters the dust container tangentially, creating a high-velocity spinning vortex (cyclone). Centrifugal force flings heavier dust and debris outward against the bin walls, where it falls to the bottom. Filtration: The partially cleaned air passes through a series of filters (foam and HEPA) to trap fine microscopic particles that escaped the cyclone. Exhaust: Clean air is exhausted out the back of the unit, often passing over the motor to cool it. How it\u2019s built? The vacuum is constructed primarily of injection-molded plastics. Chassis: Made of durable ABS plastic to withstand impact and heat. It houses the motor bucket, cord reel, and control electronics. Motor: A universal AC series motor is used for its high power-to-weight ratio. It is mounted in sound-dampening foam to reduce noise. Airpath: The airways are sealed with rubber gaskets to maintain pressure. The hose is flexible PVC reinforced with a spiral wire or plastic ridge. Bin: The dust container is transparent polycarbonate, allowing the user to see when it is full. Why did it fail, or it wasn't used anymore? Hypothesis based on common faults for this model: The device likely failed due to motor burnout caused by airflow restriction. Root Cause: Users often neglect to clean the foam/HEPA filters in bagless vacuums. As the filters clog with fine dust, airflow to the motor is restricted. Mechanism of Failure: The motor relies on incoming airflow for cooling. With blocked filters, the motor overheats. Eventually, the thermal fuse trips, or the copper windings melt/short-circuit. Alternatively, the carbon brushes in the motor may have worn down completely after years of use, breaking the electrical circuit. Weeek 2 - The Evolution Primary Inspiration \u2013 Vacuum Motor According to physics, the air a vacuum pulls in must also be released\u2014energy can neither be created nor destroyed. So instead of using the suction side of the vacuum motor in our new device, what if we utilize the opposite side, the one that blows air out?\u201d Presenting \"THE GOBLET OF MISFORTUNE\" Parts Composing it: 1.Motor blowing ; 2.Sensing dome, with motion sensors Connected to Vacuum potentiometer (used to increase and decrease intensity of voltage output) 3.Arduino with connections to led lights, motor and motion sensors Challenges are the key to innovation. For example here our aim was to effectively use a motion sensor as a 'virtual' potentiometer to regulate power intensity. The challenge was enabling this adjustment without direct manual rotation of the potentiometer itself. To overcome this, we designed and 3D-printed a custom housing for the potentiometer. This setup allows a rotating servo motor to precisely turn the potentiometer, with its movement directly corresponding to the user's distance and thus adjusting the power output. 4.Electric box (safety purposes) 5.Airflow-concentrating funnel The vacuum cleaner\u2019s motor had multiple outlet points, so to focus the airflow we 3D-printed a funnel. This funnel acted both as a focal nozzle and as a protective housing for the motor. 7.Structural support frame for the motor and associated components And Together we have... Zine: Reflections: There\u2019s a mystery that we like to keep with our machines. A kind of magic we like to imagine as designers when it comes to more technical and engineering-based products. Breaking that barrier made me realise the importance of that act. Finally seeing what\u2019s underneath and realising that this is something logical, something I can understand and maybe with time recreate is worth so much. And then to further have the chance to not just learn from what we took apart, but to make something completely new all on our own is a kind of wonder of its own. A wonder I hope to do more of now that I am more confident in my capabilities to do so.","title":"Unpacking Technology"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#unpacking-technology","text":"","title":"Unpacking Technology"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#taking-it-apart","text":"","title":"Taking It Apart"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#case-identifier-forensics-of-the-obsolescence","text":"","title":"Case identifier: Forensics of the Obsolescence"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#next-step-taking-it-apart","text":"About the machine: Brand: Rowenta Compact Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner Model: VC21VW0 Serial number: R0346301 / RO346301 Colour: ORANGE (plastic), BLACK (plastic), BLACK (resin) Made in: Germany, Romania, Spain, China, France, International","title":"Next Step : Taking it Apart"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#what-does-it-do","text":"The Rowenta Compacte Cyclonic (RO346301) is a bagless canister vacuum cleaner designed for domestic dry cleaning.

The challenge was enabling this adjustment without direct manual rotation of the potentiometer itself. To overcome this, we designed and 3D-printed a custom housing for the potentiometer. This setup allows a rotating servo motor to precisely turn the potentiometer, with its movement directly corresponding to the user's distance and thus adjusting the power output. 4.Electric box (safety purposes) 5.Airflow-concentrating funnel The vacuum cleaner\u2019s motor had multiple outlet points, so to focus the airflow we 3D-printed a funnel. This funnel acted both as a focal nozzle and as a protective housing for the motor. 7.Structural support frame for the motor and associated components","title":"Weeek 2 - The Evolution"},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#and-together-we-have","text":"Zine:","title":"And Together we have..."},{"location":"term1/Unpacking_Technology/#reflections","text":"There\u2019s a mystery that we like to keep with our machines. A kind of magic we like to imagine as designers when it comes to more technical and engineering-based products. Breaking that barrier made me realise the importance of that act. Finally seeing what\u2019s underneath and realising that this is something logical, something I can understand and maybe with time recreate is worth so much. And then to further have the chance to not just learn from what we took apart, but to make something completely new all on our own is a kind of wonder of its own. A wonder I hope to do more of now that I am more confident in my capabilities to do so.","title":"Reflections:"}]}
