Come follow me in my journey in IAAC as I explore design with different possibilities in my Masters in Design for Emergent Futures. With this Masters, I aim to channel that understanding into designing not simply to provide shelter, but to do so with dignity, care, and justice. I\u2019m endlessly fascinated by how people move through spaces \u2014 how light, material, and emotion shape our sense of home, safety, and wonder. That curiosity has led me beyond blueprints and renderings, into storytelling, research, and design thinking. Here you\u2019ll see how I get to articulate that research and thinking. } (This text and border will go all the way across the screen.)","title":"Home"},{"location":"about/me/","text":"","title":"Me"},{"location":"project/project/","text":"Initial ideas Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

In places where judicial systems are slow or stretched thin, that approach becomes not just inefficient but counterproductive. Think about speeding: yes, there are penalties if you\u2019re caught. But that still leaves two choices\u2014either you don\u2019t speed, or you speed and don\u2019t get caught. If you know where the checkpoints tend to be, avoiding detection isn\u2019t hard. What strikes me is that being \u201cgood\u201d under this model only means \u201cnot losing\u201d anything. You gain nothing tangible by following rules\u2014it\u2019s just the absence of punishment. It\u2019s like getting a participation certificate for something you didn\u2019t do poorly\u2014it\u2019s not quite recognition, it\u2019s just the absence of shame. What if society flipped that, instead of only punishing bad behaviour, it rewards good behaviour? Of course \u201cgood citizens\u201d will depend on context\u2014a country, a community, a culture\u2014but imagine a system where action is encouraged, not merely compliance out of fear. One idea is a credit-based reward system: points for paying taxes on time, points for obeying traffic laws, or for volunteering. Those points could translate into concrete benefits \u2014 reduced fees, public transport discounts, lower utility bills, or priority access to public services. Such systems are not just theoretical. Studies show that non-monetary rewards, like badges or recognition, can increase civic engagement and volunteer participation. Gamified systems often outperform non-gamified ones when it comes to sustained participation. But there\u2019s also research that warns: if rewards are too external or feel coercive, they can undermine the idea behind it.","title":"DESIGN STUDIO 1 - THE MANIFESTs"},{"location":"term1/Design_studio1.md/#design-studio-1-the-manifests","text":"I\u2019ve been reflecting lately on how, in many societies, the motivation to be a \u201cgood citizen\u201d hinges almost entirely on avoiding punishment\u2014getting fined, going to court, suffering consequences.

We wake up, get into a car or train, and sit; then we go to college or the office, where we sit some more; and after a long day, we return home only to sit on the couch again. It\u2019s no surprise that poor posture and back problems are becoming common from a young age. So in an attempt to counter and avoid that bad posture I designed a prosthesis which will help me sit straight wherever. I designed Sit Tall, a prosthetic support system that helps me maintain an upright posture wherever I sit. Sit Tall works on simple principles of physics and magnetic fields. It consists of two main components. The first is a cross-like structure that rests against the back of a chair. Its horizontal member supports my shoulders, while the lower end features a small copper disc that can be adjusted vertically to match my height. The second part is a belt fitted with an adjustable magnet. I position the belt so that the magnet sits in the concave area of my lower back. When I sit, the magnet faces the copper disc on the chair, creating opposing magnetic fields. This repelling force makes it physically difficult for my back to slouch, naturally encouraging me to sit upright. What I like about Sit Tall is that it doesn\u2019t just remind me to sit straight \u2014 it actually helps me in doing so. It\u2019s a simple, physics-driven intervention that transforms posture correction from a conscious effort into an effortless physical response. Your browser does not support the video tag. Prototype 2 - PHold These days, everything is designed to be portable \u2014 my umbrella folds small enough to fit in a coat pocket, and my headphones collapse to fit into even my smallest purse. So I started wondering: why can\u2019t my drinking glass do the same? As women, we often move through the world on alert. In crowded or chaotic places, that sense of caution heightens \u2014 and one of my biggest fears has always been the possibility of someone spiking my drink. That concern led me to design my own solution: a foldable silicon glass that disguises itself as a bracelet. It not only compresses into a compact, wearable accessory but also incorporates pH indicators that change the color of the drink if any suspicious substance is added. With this design, I\u2019ve created something that helps me feel safer and more at ease \u2014 a small innovation that reduces my reliance on society\u2019s safeguards and gives me control over my own sense of security.","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Living_with_your_own_ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"}]}
